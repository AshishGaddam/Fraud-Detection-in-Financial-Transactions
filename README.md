# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

## 📌 Overview
This project delves into the practice of financial fraud detection utilizing data mining techniques, with a particular focus on methods based on computational intelligence, including machine learning algorithms. The detection of credit card fraud in online transactions has been greatly enhanced by data mining.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Detect fraudulent credit card transactions** with high accuracy.
- **Minimize false positives**, ensuring legitimate transactions are not flagged.
- **Explore the application of data mining and machine learning** in real-world fraud detection scenarios.
- **Develop a framework** that can be extended for real-time monitoring and detection.

## 🧩 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and balancing the dataset.
- **Model Implementation**: Applying machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Utilizing techniques like Isolation Forests and Autoencoders.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Visualization**: Creating visual representations of transaction trends and fraud patterns.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Public Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (e.g., Kaggle).
- **Characteristics**: Highly imbalanced dataset (~0.17% of transactions are fraudulent).
- **Features**: Anonymized numerical values (V1, V2 … V28), transaction amount, and transaction time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Imbalanced-learn
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras (for Autoencoders and Neural Networks)

## 🚀 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values and scale numerical features.
   - Balance the dataset using techniques like SMOTE.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize fraud vs non-fraud transactions.
   - Detect anomalies and outliers.
3. **Model Training**
   - Train and compare various machine learning models.
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Measure model performance using multiple metrics.
5. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Expose the trained model as a REST API.
   - Integrate with dashboards for real-time monitoring.
